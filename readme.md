# Bitcoin Price Prediction with LSTM

## Overview
This project is designed to predict Bitcoin (BTC) prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, normalization, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- tensorflow
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Files
- `results.csv`: The dataset containing BTC price data and various technical indicators.

## Setup

1. **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib
    ```

2. **Place the `results.csv` file in the same directory as the script.**
